# Black-Highlighter-Test-Page

### WHAT IS THIS

A tool to test BHL on any SCP-Wiki page. Also includes the option to inject CSS to test themes as well.

### HOW TO USE

In order to load a specific SCP-Wiki page, just add `l?url=page-goes-here` to the end of the url.
For example: `/scp-test-page/scp-test-page.html?url=scp-5001` would load SCP-5001.

Click the button on top to reveal the CSS injector. Just paste any CSS you wish to test into the text box and hit Apply. Any new applied CSS will replace old applied CSS.

### ISSUES & TO-DO

Sometimes the page will not properly load and requires a refresh.

Would like to add the ability to import external components such as the collapsible sidebar and centered header.
